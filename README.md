# redux-isomorphic
This is a repository to track progress through the tutorial at:  https://medium.com/@bananaoomarang/handcrafting-an-isomorphic-redux-application-with-love-40ada4468af4

There will be some modifications to the original tutorial.  In particular, I intend to use the new stateless functional components in react 0.14.
